	Quick Installation:
		* Clone the repo into a folder called "forum" within your CakePHP's plugins directory.
		* Add the route to connect the forum plugin to its base URL:
			Router::connect('/forum', array('plugin' => 'forum', 'controller' => 'home', 'action' => 'index'));
		* Run the schema SQL to generate your database tables.

Translating
============

	If you would like to translate the forum into a new language, or fix a previous language.
	Simply fork the repo and follow the instructions below, you will need to download PoEdit: http://www.poedit.net/

	Once you have done that, just follow these steps.

	1 - Open the program and go to File > New catalog from POT file
	2 - Fill in the settings box with the following information

		Project: Cupcake Forum Plugin
		Team: Miles Johnson
		Team Email: contact@milesj.me
		Language: <Pick the language>
		Country: <Pick the country>
		Charset: UTF-8
		Source code: UTF-8
		Plural: <Leave blank>

	3 - Hit ok
	4 - Save the file as forum.po and place it anywhere
	5 - Once saved, the program should populate with the text on the left
	6 - Translate the sentences on the left by typing in the translation box in the bottom
	7 - When you come across text with the %s and %d symbols, that means those symbols will be replaced with dynamic data

		Example:
		%d = Integer/Number
		%s = Text/String

		"The forum %s has been deleted, and all its forum categories have been moved!"
		"The forum General Discussion has been deleted, and all its forum categories have been moved!"

		So those ARE REQUIRED to work correctly, just place those symbols where they would be within the translated string.
		You may find some others like %count% and %total%; leave those as they are as well.

	8 - When you are done, simply save the file
	9 - You should now have 2 files, a .po and a .mo
	10 - Open up the .po with Notepad and you should see the following

		#: /controllers/categories_controller.php:101
		msgid "A total of %d topic(s) have been permanently deleted"
		msgstr "<YOUR TRANSLATED VERSION HERE>"

	11 - Create a folder for your language within the locale folder, based on the 3 character locale: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
	12 - Within the language folder, create the LC_MESSAGES folder and place the .po file within.
	13 - Commit and push! Once done, I will review and merge with your changes.
